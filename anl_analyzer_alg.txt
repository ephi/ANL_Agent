ANL_Analyzer
------------
1) Define ANL_RES_PATH as a path to the json folder of results
2) define AUL map
3) for each *_negotiation.json file in ANL_RES_PATH
  3.2) define UL map
  3.2) for each "offer" in "actions" get "utilities"
       3.3) for each "agent name" in "utilities" do:
       	    3.4) if util list UL["agent name"] doesn't exist for "agent name" create a UL["agent name"] for him
	    3.5) append util value to UL["agent name"]
  3.6) for "accept" in "actions"
       3.7) for each "agent name" in "utilities" do: 
           3.8) append util value to UL["agent name"] marked as accepted
           3.9) if avg util AUL["agent name"] doesn't exist create it
           3.10) append util("agent name") to AUL["agent name"]
  3.11) plot for each element in UL historical data of utils offered and accepted util (accepted util should be marked differently)
3) for each agent in AUL calculate average util. Sum all AUL["agent name"] into A_AUL["agent name"], then, A_AUL["agent name"] <= A_AUL["agent name"]/# of *_negotiation.json files 
4) plot the accepted utils for all agents
5) revesred (high to low) the A_AUL, and print the agent names with avg util values to determine the ranking
